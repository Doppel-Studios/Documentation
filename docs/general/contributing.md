## Tracking Work

We use Kanban boards to keep track of work on projects.

## Changes to Project

We use Git as our version control and GitHub as our remote host. If you have gotten the project setup then you are able to request changes to the project.

All changes must be made on a branch of master. For more information on making changes in a branch checkout GitHubs [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch).

To get your changes into the project a GitHub [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) for the master branch needs to be made. While still figuring out the contribution flow send the link to a team member to have them review before merging your changes.
