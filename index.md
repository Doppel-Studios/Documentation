## Getting started

### Game Engine

Our game engine of choice is [Unity](https://unity.com/). To set up Unity, sign up for an account with them and follow their [guide](https://unity.com/download). We use Unity version [2020.3.37f1](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases).

### Version Control

Version control software enables both team contribution and provides backup history incase something goes wrong. We use Git and GitHub for our version control. To learn more about Git and GitHub checkout their [Get Started](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started) page. To set up version congrol, sign up for an account with Github and follow their [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git). You will need to share your GitHub username with somone who is already set up to gain access to the projects.

### Clone Template Project

A good place to start learning is the [Template Project](https://github.com/Doppel-Studios/Template-Project) our games are built from. This is a simple Unity project which has a minimal implementation of the topics covered here and will be a good reference to complement this documentation. To get this project onto your computer, add a spot for it in your files and [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the [repository](https://github.com/Doppel-Studios/Template-Project). Now that you have the project in your local files you can open it to see how its made and run it.

### Finished Setup

Great, you are all set and can now open and run the template project. If your having trouble or something isnt working please let someone know. Otherwise Explore some of the other pages of documnentation to learn how everything works. The next best thing to learn will probably be where what your looking for is and the projects [file structure](file-structure).
